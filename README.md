**Work in progress**


## TODO:

* Use TravisCI to render out the example site fixture to an Amazon S3 bucket so that people can see a demo
* JavaScript - likely implement via Webpack. SystemJS? Or similar universal module loader.
* SASS
* More tests
* Refactor core. Currently this represents a proof of concept but needs some serious tidying up.
* ~Rendering component documentation~
* ~Frontmatter support~
* ~Ability to define full pages which are constructed out of the various components~
